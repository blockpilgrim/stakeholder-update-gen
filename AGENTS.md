## Project Tracking

Implementation is tracked in Linear under the **SUG-MVP** project. 

## Session Start

At the beginning of each session, it is important that you read and internalize the product concept as described in `stakeholder-update-generator-concept-brief.md`. 

## Working in Linear

- When starting work on Linear issues, always check the issue status. If the issue is "In Progress", that may mean that work has already begun on it. In such cases, always read issue comments in addition to the main issue details. Comments may contain context from previous work sessions or other AI agents. If the issue status is "Backlog" or "Todo", and the user has asked you to work on it, then set the issue status to "In Progress". 
- Any time you've conducted work on a Linear issue, add a comment to the issue documenting what you've done, implementation status (e.g. complete, unresolved bugs), along with any important context/notes worth mentioning which AI agents in future sessions may find helpful (for instance, in case there are related sub-issues or other dependencies).

## Git Commits

- use all lowercase text, formatted simply and concisely.
- no need to go into deep detail about what's been implemented. treat commits like guideposts which point us in the right direction if we ever need to learn about what was implemented; but we don't necessarily want to learn all details from the commit itself. focus on brevity while still being helpful and clear. 
- do not mention "droid", "factory", or anything else related to AI tools
